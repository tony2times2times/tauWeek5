Description
Welcome to your LAST weekend challenge!

In this challenge, you will be creating a Pet Application that allows a user to create Pets records that are stored in a database. The list will be displayed on the DOM.

You will need the following:

[] At the top of the page should be a greeting with some direction on how to use the application,

[] Next, should be a inputs where the user can add a new pet with a form,

[] Below all of that should be a list of the entered pets.

[] You will use the full MEAN stack for this (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)

[X]Each Pet will need to have the following information:

Name (example, Grilled Cheese)
Animal (example, Cat),
Age (example, 14)
Image Url
Everyone, post info and image URL links to your pets in the #tau slack channel by saturday morning. I'll then put them on my server and provide urls that we can use.

Jedi Knight Mode
Look into delete functionality. Add a button in the Pets List to delete a pet from the database. This will require research in how to identify the pet that is supposed to be deleted from the database.

Jedi Master Mode
Use Angular Routes to have a view for each function:

Home view (description/landing)
Add
All Pets
Jedi Council Member Mode
Look into Filtering. In the Pets view, include a button to turn on Alphabetical Sorting of the pets that can be toggled on and off.
